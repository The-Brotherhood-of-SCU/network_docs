## Network Application Architecture
- Application **communicating,distribute processes**
  - hosts in **"user spece"**
  - exchange messages to implement application
- Application-layer protocols
  - define messages exchanged by apps and actions taken
  - **user services provided by lower layer protocols**
  
## Processes Communicating
- Client
